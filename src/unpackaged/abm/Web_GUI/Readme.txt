Agent Based Modelling Programme

A programme to animate the movement of 'n number of agents around a set environment whilst they interact with the environment and each other.

The programme is run by calling model.py and passing in 3 arguments as text (number):
	Number of agents
	Number of agent moves (iterations of move)
	Size of agents search neighbourhood

The programme is run from a GUI that will initiate, and will animate their movement, the programme will run till all iterations have completed,
or a stopping condition is met, when one agent has collected 100 pieces of the environment. 

Issues

Once complete the user must close the GUI and kill the programme by pressing crtl+c.
Documentation is only present for the agentsFramework class, as I couldn't get either Pydoc or Sphinx to write the documentation for model.py
